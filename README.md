# 🧬 ECG-Based Non-Invasive Kidney Health Monitor

A real-time, non-invasive system that estimates kidney function trends using ECG, vital signals, and machine learning — without blood tests.

# 🚀 Overview

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) often remains undetected until advanced stages due to the need for repeated blood tests and limited screening access. This project presents a portable, ECG-driven kidney health monitoring prototype that estimates eGFR trends using cardio–renal signals and machine learning.

The system is designed for early screening, continuous monitoring, and remote healthcare support, especially in low-resource settings.

# 🧠 System Flow

ECG + Vital Signals + Demographics  
→ Machine Learning Model  
→ eGFR Estimation  
→ Kidney Health Stage & Alerts

# 🔬 Key Features

• ECG-based cardio–renal analysis using heart rate, HRV, and QRS duration  
• Vital sign monitoring with temperature and optical (PPG) heart rate  
• Machine learning–based eGFR estimation using Gradient Boosting Regression  
• Real-time backend API with web/app integration  
• Privacy-first design with no database dependency  

# ⚙️ Tech Stack

Hardware: Arduino, ECG (gel electrodes), Optical Sensor, Temperature Sensor  
Backend: Python, Flask  
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Gradient Boosting Regressor)  
Frontend: React  

# 🩺 Output

• Estimated eGFR (mL/min/1.73m²)  
• Kidney function stage (G1–G5)  
• Confidence score and clinical interpretation  


# 🌍 Why It Matters

• CKD affects ~13% of India’s population, with low awareness and late diagnosis  
• Enables frequent, low-cost kidney health screening  
• Supports telemedicine and preventive healthcare  
• Reduces dependency on repeated blood tests for early risk detection  

# 📈 Future Scope

• Blood pressure integration  
• Bioimpedance-based fluid assessment  
• Training with clinical datasets  
• Long-term trend analysis and alerts  

# 👥 Team Collaboration

• Hardware: ECG and sensor data acquisition  
• Machine Learning: Feature modeling and eGFR prediction  
• Backend: API development and data flow  
• Frontend: User interface and visualization  

# ⭐ Use Cases

• Community health screening  
• Rural and low-access healthcare  
• Preventive health monitoring  
• Research and academic demonstrations  

Early detection saves kidneys.  
Non-invasive monitoring makes it accessible.
